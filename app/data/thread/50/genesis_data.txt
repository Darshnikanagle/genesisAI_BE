The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20

cricket league in India organised by the Board of Control for

Cricket in India (BCCI).[1] Founded in 2007, the league features ten

state or city-based franchise teams.[2] The IPL is the most

popular and richest cricket league in the world and is held between

March and May. It has an exclusive window in the Future Tours

Programme of the International Cricket Council (ICC), resulting in

fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL

seasons.[3] It is also the most viewed sports competition in India, as

per the Broadcast Audience Research Council.[4][5]

In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance among all sports

leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be

broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][11][12] In 2022, the league's brand value was estimated at â‚¹90,038 crore (US$11

billion).[13] According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL season

contributed â‚¹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to India's GDP.[14] In

December 2022, the IPL achieved a valuation of US$10.9 billion, becoming a decacorn and registering a 75% growth in dollar terms

since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a

report by the consulting firm D and P Advisory.[15] Its 2023

final became the most streamed live event on the internet, with 32

million viewers.[16]

In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next 4 seasons for

US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,[17] meaning each IPL

match was valued at $13.4 million.[18] As of 2024, there have

been seventeen seasons of the tournament. The current champions

are the Kolkata Knight Riders, who won the 2024 season after

defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.[19] In just six years, the

IPL's value has more than doubled, reaching $12 billion in 2024.[20]

Background

In April 2007, Essel Group launched the Indian Cricket

League (ICL), in partnership with IL&FS.[21][22] The ICL was not

recognized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or

the International Cricket Council (ICC). Moreover, the BCCI was

unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executive

board.[23][24] In response, the BCCI increased the prize money for

its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players

who joined the ICL, which it considered a rebel league.[25][26]

Foundation

On 13 September 2007, as the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 began, the BCCI launched the Indian Premier League, an annual franchiseï¿¾based Twenty20 cricket competition.[27] The inaugural season was

scheduled to start in April 2008, commencing with a "high-profile

ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led

the IPL initiative, provided details of the tournament, including its

format, prize money, franchise revenue system, and squad

composition rules. The league, to be managed by a seven-man

governing council, would also serve as the qualifying mechanism for

that year's Champions League Twenty20.[27][28]

To determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was

held on 24 January 2008. The reserve prices for the eight

franchises totalled $400 million,[26] but the auction ultimately

raised $723.59 million.[29] The league officially commenced in

April 2008, featuring Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Mumbai

Indians (MI), Delhi Daredevils (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), Deccan

Chargers (DC), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).[30]

In 2009, the BCCI and other national boards offered amnesty to

rival ICL's players and officials, provided they terminated their

contracts. The resulting player exodus and financial difficulties

forced ICL to shut down later that year.[31][32][33]
